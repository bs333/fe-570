**Glosten-Harris model**. The Glosten-Harris model is an improvement of the Roll model which takes into account:

- Bid-ask bounce: $cd_t$
- Price impact: $\lambdax_t$

In this model, trade price $p_t$ is given by:

$$p_t = m_t + cd_t + \lambda x_t$$

where the efficient price $m_t$ contains a price impact $\lambda x_{t-1}$ due to the previous trade:

$$m_t = m_{t-1} + \lambda x_{t-1} + \mu_t$$

Here, $u_t$ are iid random variables with mean zero and variance $\sigma_u^2$, similar to the Roll model.

Note that here, $x_t$ are *signed* trade sizes: positive for buy, negative for sell.

## Question

Calibrate the $\lambda$, $c$ parameters of this model using the provided TAQ dataset. The dataset provided contains trades and quotes for KO (Coca-Cola) on 1-Mar-2022.

For this analysis it is important to exclude from the analysis large trades at the start and end of the trading session. For example, keep only trades
with time stamps between 10:00 - 14:00.
