**Glosten-Harris model**. The Glosten-Harris model is an improvement of the Roll model which takes into account:

- Bid-ask bounce: $cd_t$
- Price impact: $\lambdax_t$

In this model, trade price $p_t$ is given by:

$$p_t = m_t + cd_t + \lambda x_t$$

where the efficient price $m_t$ contains a price impact $\lambda x_{t-1}$ due to the previous trade:

$$m_t = m_{t-1} + \lambda x_{t-1} + \mu_t$$

Here, $u_t$ are iid random variables with mean zero and variance $\sigma_u^2$, similar to the Roll model.

Note that here, $x_t$ are *signed* trade sizes: positive for buy, negative for sell.
